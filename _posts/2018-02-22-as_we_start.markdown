BELIEVED 
IN MIRACLES

Everyone seems to be talking about coding these days. Some already know how to code, some are keen observers of the trend, and some actually start to learn how to code. 

I am one of the last group of people who actually made the bold decision and jumped to run down a new career path. 

Initial reaction to my life changing decision was, "YOU of all people, I never expected you to be a developer!" It was not the most encouraging reaction yet it was understandable. I wanted to be a dolphin trainer when I was little, then I decided to pursue my passion in film and worked at a production company, studied media and cinema studies in college, and currentlywork at a media agency in NYC. 

However, once you decide to learn these new languages, you will soon find out that people come from such diverse backgrounds with interesting stories. Yes, there are people who majored in computer science or math but I met a violinist with ash-purple hair, a finance guy wearing a vest, a graphic designer, and so on.

Coding sounds just as intimidating as rocket science to many of us (myself included) but we can't deny its appeal that it attracted all these different groups of people. Try making a list of your "why code" and I am sure you will be nodding by the time you read the last bullet point from your list.

I don't believe in miracles but I do believe that learning coding will open new doors for all of us muffins!
