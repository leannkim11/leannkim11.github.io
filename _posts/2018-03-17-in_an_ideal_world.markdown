In an ideal world, the universe would be so supportive of our decisions - especially a good one such as joining coding bootcamp. Not so surprisingly, we don't live in a world full of rainbow unicorns that put food on the table for us . If you are juggling coding bootcamp and work, work might get in your way with a code blue warning. (Els)if you live in one of the most expensive cities in the world like New York, your landlord might have decided to bump up the rent that you have no choice but to look for a new place to live. Your might have or haven't told your friends about your new journey but they still might want to socialize and be very persistent about having a fun friday night regardless.

There are so many things that could possibly be holding you back. My coworker's baby came out of the blue and I didn't even know he was even married (yes - he's the dad) and he decided to use all of his vacation days he carried over from last year. I am trying to code with my laptop sitting on top of a paper box full of kitchen gadgets because I already sold my old coffee table that is too big for my new apartment. Not to mention all of those friends who are chanting YOLO next to my ears.

As I was entering the panic zone, I was told by my wonderful coach Leslie that we are all encountering small and BIG problems as we speak and I shouldn't fight back with a force when there's a bigger force heading in your direction. We can't control every situation and the clock doesn't slow down just because we have more responsibilities than before. If that's the case, let's have fun and play along until we can pace ourselves again. 

It's not a race after all!
